# ETL_Mini_Project
*This collaborative mini project builds an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and PostgreSQL for extracting, transforming, and loading crowdfunding data from Excel files into a relational database.*

**Project Components**<br>
*The mini project is divided into the following subsections:*
* Extract and transform crowdfunding and contact data from Excel files
* Create and export Category, Subcategory, Campaign, and Contact DataFrames as CSV files
* Design an ERD and table schema for the database
* Create and populate PostgreSQL database tables

**Category and Subcategory DataFrames**<br>
*The Category DataFrame has the following columns and was exported as a [category.csv](Resources/category.csv) CSV file:*<br>

**Crowdfunding Database**<br>
*The four CSV files were used to sketch an [ERD crowdfunding diagram] of the tables. Information from the ERD was then used to create a [crowdfunding table schema] for each CSV file.
